# Terminal.nvim [WIP]

A plugin meant to simplify the process of using the builtin terminal in Neovim.

## Installation

Packer: 

```lua
use 'mortepau/terminal.nvim'
```

Vim-Plug:

```vim
Plug 'mortepau/terminal.nvim'
```

## Basic usage

This plugin should behave pretty much just like the built-in `:terminal`, but
can be configured to ease the task of using it.

The first and most important command is `:Terminal`.

## Configuration

## Todo

[ ] - List all available terminals
    [ ] - <bang> to list only alive or all
[ ] - Feed input to a specific terminal
[ ] - Restart initial command in terminal
[ ] - Move terminal
